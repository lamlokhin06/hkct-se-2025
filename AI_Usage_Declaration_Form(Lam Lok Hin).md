## AI Tool Usage Summary

**Did you use any AI tools for this assignment?** [x] Yes [ ] No

If yes, please provide a brief summary of your AI usage:

### AI Tools Used

- **Tool 1:** poe
- **Tool 2:** 
- **Tool 3:** 

### Summary of AI Assistance

**What did you use AI for?** (e.g., debugging, learning concepts, generating boilerplate code, code review)

```
AI was primarily used to generate initial versions of code snippets and to assist with understanding complex concepts in javascript and CSS.
```

**What percentage of your code was AI-generated?**

- [ ] Less than 10%
- [x] 10-25%
- [ ] 25-50%
- [ ] 50-75%
- [ ] More than 75%

**How did you modify and integrate AI-generated code?**

```
I took the AI-generated code and adjusted variable names to fit my project’s naming conventions, ensured proper commenting was added, and modified logic to better align with my project requirements.
```

**Understanding Check:**
**Can you explain how the AI-generated code works?** (e.g., what each function does, how the logic flows, what the key concepts are)

```
The AI-generated code primarily consists of functions that handle image uploads and label assignments. I chose to use it because it provided a solid foundation to build upon, and I needed to understand how to implement file handling in JavaScript.
```

**Modification Evidence:**
**What changes did you make to the AI-generated code?** (e.g., variable names, logic adjustments, integration with your existing code)

```
I changed variable names to be more descriptive, added error handling for file uploads, and integrated the generated code with existing functions in my application.
```

## Additional External Assistance

**Online Resources Used:**

W3Schools: JavaScript File Upload
This resource provided a clear tutorial on how to implement file upload functionality in JavaScript, including handling files and displaying them on the web page. It helped me understand the basics I needed to get started.

**Group Discussion Contributions:**

Discussing code structure with my peers helped me realize the importance of modular design. They encouraged me to break down my functions into smaller, reusable components, enhancing both readability and maintainability of my code.

## Learning Reflection

**What did you learn from using AI tools?**

```
Using AI tools deepened my understanding of JavaScript functions and how to structure my code efficiently. I learned how to quickly generate useful snippets that I can adapt.
```

**What challenges did you face when integrating AI-generated code?**

```
I faced challenges with ensuring that the AI-generated suggestions fit seamlessly into my existing project set-up, especially regarding variable scope and function calls.
```

**How did you ensure the final code was your own work?**

```
I ensured the final code was my own by closely reviewing all AI-generated content, modifying it to meet my specific needs, and understanding the logic behind each piece of code.
```
